README for generated code
-------------------------

The C bindings in 'libvirt_c.c' are now generated automatically by a
Perl script called 'generator.pl'.  You do not normally need to run
this script, but you may need to if you want to extend libvirt
coverage.

The generated 'libvirt_c.c' #includes some other C files in this
directory:

  #include "libvirt_c_prologue.c"

    A prologue that prototypes some static functions which are defined
    in the epilogue (see below), and provides some general macros.

  #include "libvirt_c_oneoffs.c"

    One-off bindings: Bindings which are too specialised or one-of-a-kind
    to be worth generating automatically.

  [Followed by generated bindings, then ...]

  #include "libvirt_c_epilogue.c"

    An epilogue which defines some standard static functions (eg.) for
    wrapping and unwrapping libvirt objects.
