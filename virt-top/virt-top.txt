NAME
    virt-top - 'top'-like utility for virtualization stats

SUMMARY
    virt-top [-options]

DESCRIPTION
    virt-top is a top(1)-like utility for showing stats of virtualized
    domains. Many keys and command line options are the same as for ordinary
    *top*.

    It uses libvirt so it is capable of showing stats across a variety of
    different virtualization systems.

OPTIONS
    -1  Display physical CPUs by default (instead of domains). When virt-top
        is running, use the *1* key to toggle between physical CPUs and
        domains display.

    -2  Display network interfaces by default (instead of domains). When
        virt-top is running, use the *2* key to toggle between network
        interfaces and domains display.

    -3  Display block devices (virtual disks) by default (instead of
        domains). When virt-top is running, use the *3* key to toggle
        between block devices and domains display.

    -b  Batch mode. In this mode keypresses are ignored.

    -c uri or --connect uri
        Connect to URI given. The default is to connect to the Xen
        hypervisor.

    -d delay
        Set the delay between screen updates in seconds. The default is 3.0
        seconds. You can change this while virt-top is running by pressing
        either *s* or *d* key.

    -n iterations
        Set the number of iterations to run. The default is to run
        continuously.

    -o sort
        Set the sort order to one of: cpu (sort by %CPU used), mem (sort by
        memory used), time (sort by total time), id (sort by domain ID),
        name (sort by domain name), netrx (sort by network received bytes),
        nettx (sort by network transmitted bytes), blockrdrq (sort by block
        device [disk] read requests), blockwrrq (sort by block device [disk]
        write requests).

        While virt-top is running you can change the sort order using keys
        *P* (cpu), *M* (memory), *T* (total time), *N* (domain ID), *F*
        (interactively select the sort field).

    -s  Secure mode. Currently this does nothing.

    --hist-cpu secs
        Set the time in seconds between updates of the historical %CPU at
        the top right of the display.

    --csv file.csv
        Write the statistics to file *file.csv*. First a header is written
        showing the statistics being recorded in each column, then one line
        is written for each screen update. The CSV file can be loaded
        directly by most spreadsheet programs.

        Currently the statistics which this records vary between releases of
        virt-top (but the column headers will stay the same, so you can use
        those to process the CSV file).

        Not every version of virt-top supports CSV output - it depends how
        the program was compiled (see *README* file in the source
        distribution for details).

    --debug filename
        Send debug and error messages to *filename*. To send error messages
        to syslog you can do:

         virt-top --debug >(logger -t virt-top)

        See also REPORTING BUGS below.

    --help
        Display usage summary.

KEYS
    Note that keys are case sensitive. For example use upper-case *P* (shift
    P) to sort by %CPU. *^* before a key means a Ctrl key, so *^L* is Ctrl
    L.

    *space* or *^L*
        Updates the display.

    *q* Quits the program.

    *h* Displays help.

    *s* or *d*
        Change the delay between screen updates.

    *0* (number 0)
        Show the normal list of domains display.

    *1* (number 1)
        Toggle into showing physical CPUs. If pressed again toggles back to
        showing domains (the normal display).

    *2* Toggle into showing network interfaces. If pressed again toggles
        back to showing domains.

    *3* Toggle into showing block devices (virtual disks). If pressed again
        toggles back to showing domains.

    *P* Sort by %CPU.

    *M* Sort by memory.

    *T* Sort by total time.

    *N* Sort by domain ID.

    *F* Select the sort field interactively (there are other sort fields you
        can choose using this key).

REPORTING BUGS
    Bugs can be viewed on the Red Hat Bugzilla page:
    <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/>.

    If you find a bug in virt-top, please follow these steps to report it:

    1. Check for existing bug reports
        Go to <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/> and search for similar bugs.
        Someone may already have reported the same bug, and they may even
        have fixed it.

    2. Capture debug and error messages
        Run

         virt-top --debug virt-top.log

        and keep *virt-top.log*. It contains error messages which you should
        submit with your bug report.

    3. Get version of virt-top and version of libvirt.
        In virt-top, press the *h* (help) key, and write down the version of
        virt-top and the version of libvirt. They are shown in the first
        line.

    4. Submit a bug report.
        Go to <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/> and enter a new bug. Please
        describe the problem in as much detail as possible.

        Remember to include the version numbers (step 3) and the debug
        messages file (step 2).

    5. Assign the bug to rjones @ redhat.com
        Assign or reassign the bug to rjones @ redhat.com (without the
        spaces). You can also send me an email with the bug number if you
        want a faster response.
